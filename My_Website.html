      <h2>Why I love movies</h2>
        <p>I have loved movies ever since I was a little kid.  My dad was a Film/TV/Radio college major and he used to make short films before I was born.  When I was a little kid, he took me to the movies all the time.  He introduced me to his favorites, and helped me develop my own taste in movies.  I am grateful that he took the time to share his passion for movies with me, and it is something that we have in common to this day.</p>
